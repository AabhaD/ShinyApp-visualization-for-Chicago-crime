# ShinyApp
This is an interactive ShinyApp Dashboard. 

The data set contains the reported incidents of crime in the City of Chicago. 
Variable descriptions and other details about the data set can be found in the following site: 
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2. 
The attached data file contains information from 2020 only.

Tab 1: Frequency of crime by month and crime type. Create bar charts for different month crime type combinations.

Tab 2: Location of crimes by date on a map.

Tab 3: A heatmap using the type of the crime and the hour of the day when the crime was committed. (The goal of this heatmap is to identify any relationship 
between crime type and hour at which the crime is committed.)

Tab 4: Community Area Crime Frequency.
